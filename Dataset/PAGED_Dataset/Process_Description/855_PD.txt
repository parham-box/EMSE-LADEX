To start the process, we receive the contract for the marketing campaign. Once we have the contract, we take it to the department. In the next step, we input the customer's details into NKE. If the customer's details are missing, we contact the customers. However, if the customer's details are ready, we create a suitable team. After contacting the customers, we receive additional customer details. Then, we create the team and check previous campaigns for reusable material. Upon finding reusable ideas from previous campaigns, we create a new concept. Once the new concept is created, we integrate new ideas and add further points. Next, we integrate the revised campaign into the database. The concept is then presented to the relevant party for consideration. If the concept is declined, we rework it. On the other hand, if the concept is accepted, we proceed to present it to the customer. This marks the end of the process.
