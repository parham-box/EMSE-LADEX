To start the process for ACME Company, we first trigger the Resupply Cycle. After that, we check the inventory level. Once the inventory level is checked, we proceed to create a purchase order. If the purchase order is not good, we reject it. However, if the purchase order is good, we approve it. In case the purchase order is rejected, we rework it. On the other hand, if the purchase order is approved, we reserve funds for the purchase. After reworking the purchase order, we review it again. Once the funds are reserved, we send the purchase order to the supplier. Simultaneously, we complete the following steps: receive the packing slip and receive the invoice. After receiving the packing slip, we record it. Similarly, after receiving the invoice, we record it as well. Next, we release funds for payment and issue the payment. Finally, the process ends after the payment is issued.
