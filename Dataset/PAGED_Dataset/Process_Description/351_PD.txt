The process starts with the Request for Quotation, followed by the Customer submitting the RFQ. After the RFQ is submitted, the Quotation is also submitted. Once the Quotation is submitted, we receive it. Upon receiving the Quotation, we then submit the Purchase Order. Simultaneously, we complete two steps: sending the Goods and sending the Invoice. After the Goods are sent, we mark them as sent. Similarly, after the Invoice is sent, we mark it as sent. The process ends when the Goods are sent or when the Invoice is sent.
