To make queries of an object ID to ADS, the process begins by resolving the ONS-Resolving URN to a domain-name. Once the ONS-Resolving URN is resolved to a domain-name, a DNS query is sent. After sending the DNS query, a list of URLs is received in return. Upon receiving the list of URLs, the next step is to link to a designated DS and send the query. Finally, the process ends.
