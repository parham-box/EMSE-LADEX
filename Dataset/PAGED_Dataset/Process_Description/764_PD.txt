As a Recruitment Manager, you should begin the process by identifying the vacancy and then considering your options. After considering your options, you should proceed to develop or update the position profile. Once the position profile is developed or updated, you can then determine the terms and conditions. If the position is "required", you should complete the requisition for staff and business case. Otherwise, you can continue with the process. The process will end once these steps are completed.
