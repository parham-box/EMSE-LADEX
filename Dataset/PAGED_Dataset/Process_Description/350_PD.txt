To start, you need to note the vendor number on the Invoice entry form. If you choose to "Sort Invoice by vendor", you should proceed with the process. However, if you decide to "Sort invoice by invoice amount", you should also continue with the process. It takes approximately 20 minutes for every 100 invoices, and once you have entered the invoice data, make sure to tick "invoice entered" on the invoice entry form. After ticking the box, you can proceed with the process. Once you have placed the invoice batch in the Urgent Outbox, it will be collected every hour. The collection process will continue every hour until the end of the overall process.
