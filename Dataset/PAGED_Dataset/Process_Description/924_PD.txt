For AMAG: Initially, we receive a sealed shipment. After that, we proceed to register the spare parts. Once the spare parts are registered, we can then clear customs. It is important to note that during the registration of spare parts, barcode scanners should be used. Finally, after clearing customs, we enter the information into the IT system, and the process is completed.
