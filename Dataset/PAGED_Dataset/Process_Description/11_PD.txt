To begin the process, create a Temporary ID. After that, proceed to access the eLiving System. Once in the eLiving System, verify the student's identity. If the student's identity is confirmed, check if their account is frozen. If it is frozen, unfreeze the student account. If it is not frozen, continue with the process. Next, navigate to the Harco System and select "Cardholder Transactions". From there, choose the option for "Forgotten Card". In the "Forgotten Card" section, enter the reason code and temporary card number. After providing the reason code and temporary card number, move on to the point of sale system. In the point of sale system, scan the temporary card to complete the process.
