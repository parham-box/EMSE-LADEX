To start, you should join the team and agree on the team's domain. Once that is done, create a process model and check it. If the process model is "NOT OK", then assign negative points. If it is still "NOT OK", assign negative points again. However, if the process is okay, you can continue with it. If there are any issues, fix them in the next session and extend the process to levels 2 and 3. If you need to check the process and assign points, continue with the process. If you need to analyze the field of study, assign roles in the team. If the process is okay, continue with the process and perform work according to your assigned role. Check the progress and consult any problems that arise. If the project is accepted, present it. If not, continue working according to your role. If the project is accepted, present it again. If not, continue working according to your role. Finally, present the project and the process will come to an end.
