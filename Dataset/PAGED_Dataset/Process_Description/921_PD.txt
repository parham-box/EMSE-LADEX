To start the process for ACME, begin with the New Resupply Cycle and then proceed to Check Levels of Inventory. If the inventory is "greater than" the minimum, generate an "Above Minimum Report". If it is "below or equal to" the minimum, generate an "Equal to or below minimum Report". If the inventory is "greater than" the minimum, generate an "Above Minimum Report". If it is "below or equal to" the minimum, generate an "Equal to or below minimum Report". If an "Above Minimum Report" is generated, then the process ends with the End Resupply Cycle. If an "Equal to or below minimum Report" is generated, then POs are Created. Once the POs are Created, they are subject to POs Review. If the POs are "rejected", they need to be "reworked". If they are "approved", they are "Printed and released in the system" and the process ends. If the POs are "rejected", they need to be "reworked". If they are "approved", they are "Printed and released in the system" and the process ends. If the POs are "reworked", then POs are Created again.
