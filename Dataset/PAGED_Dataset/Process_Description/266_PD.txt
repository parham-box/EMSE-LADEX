To initiate the IDES process, begin by starting and then requesting a quotation. After requesting a quotation, proceed to create the quotation. Once the quotation is created, compare prices. Following the price comparison, create a contract. After the contract is created, move on to creating a purchase requisition. Once the purchase requisition is created, assign it to a source. After assigning the requisition to a source, create a purchase order. Once the purchase order is created, process the inbound delivery. After processing the inbound delivery, post the goods receipt. Following the goods receipt, verify the invoice. After verifying the invoice, proceed to process any blocked invoices. Once the blocked invoices are processed, make the payment to the vendor. Finally, the process ends.
