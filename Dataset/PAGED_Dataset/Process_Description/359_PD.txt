To begin the process, start by recording the registration information. After that, check for prerequisites. Once the prerequisites have been checked, verify if the student is in good standing. Once the student's standing has been verified, issue the bill for tuition and fees. After the bill has been issued, verify the payment of fees. Once the fee payment has been verified, record the student as registered. This is where the process ends.
