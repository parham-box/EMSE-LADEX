To begin the process for MyCompany, start by placing an Order and then proceed to Check the Customer. If the task is to "Check Customer's Availabilities," then continue with the check by verifying the "End Customer?" If, on the other hand, the task is to "Check Credit," then proceed with the process. If the next step is to "Enroll Customer," then first Check the Credit. However, if the decision is to "Reject," then the process comes to an end. In case of a rejection, the process simply ends.
