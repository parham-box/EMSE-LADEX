To start the process, I was feeling really stressed and then I made the decision to go on vacation. If I decided yes, then I would choose the travel method. However, if I decided no, then I would resign from my job. Once I resigned from my job, the process would come to an end. If I chose the plane as my travel method, then I would proceed with booking the tickets. On the other hand, if I chose the car, then I would book a hotel. After booking the tickets, they would be successfully booked. Similarly, after booking the hotel, it would be successfully booked as well. Once the luggage was packed, I would take it to the car. Finally, when the luggage was taken to the car, the process would come to an end.
