To begin the process, start by checking the customer's order. If the customer is a registered customer, then check their payment morale. If they are a new customer, then check their status. If their payment morale is good, continue with the process. If their payment morale is bad or if they are an end customer, reject the order and end the process. If the customer is a wholesaler, enter their data and take the order. At the same time, check the availability of the items. If the items are out of stock, start production. If they are in stock, continue with the process. Once the availability is checked, send the order confirmation. If production is started, produce the article and send the order confirmation. Simultaneously, send the invoice and deliver the product. Check the payment status. If payment is received, close the order. If no payment is received, check the number of reminders. If there are more than three reminders, engage a lawyer. If there are three or fewer reminders, send a reminder.
