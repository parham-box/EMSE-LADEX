To start, we need to create the board. Once the board is created, we can proceed to place the monsters in the designated area. After the monsters are placed, we can then proceed to place various items such as chests, glyphs, and doors. Once all the items are in place, it is time to give the conquest tokens to the HeroParty. Finally, we can conclude the process by drawing three overlord cards.
