To begin, start by providing the requested shipping information. After that, proceed to determine the shipping details. If a "Saved shipping address" has been selected, then continue with the process. However, if a "New shipping address" has been entered, also continue with the process. Once that is done, confirm the shipping address and ensure that it is correct. After confirming the shipping address, proceed to select the desired shipping speed. Finally, once the shipping speed has been chosen, the process comes to an end.
