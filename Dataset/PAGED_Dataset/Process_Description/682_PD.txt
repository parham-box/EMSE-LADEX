At first, you need to Calculate Insurance. After that, Present Insurance Conditions. Once the conditions are presented, we will ask if you want insurance. If your answer is "no", we will continue the process. However, if your answer is "yes", we will proceed to Book Insurance. If you still answer "no", we will continue the process. But if you answer "yes" again, we will Book Insurance and the process will come to an end.
