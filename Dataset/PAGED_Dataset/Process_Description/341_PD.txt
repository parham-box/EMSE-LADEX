To acquire a new client, the first step is to identify the need for a new client. Simultaneously, it is important to complete the following tasks: prepare a portfolio presentation and analyze the market. Once these steps are done, the next step is to send an offer to the potential client. After sending the offer, it is necessary to inform management about the potential client's responses. Following this, the responses need to be analyzed and negotiations can begin. During the negotiation process, it is important to detail the offer according to the client's preferences and receive their response. If the response is positive, the next step is to prepare a contract for signing. However, if the response is negative, it is important to analyze the reasons for the rejection and learn from the experience. Once the contract is prepared, it can be signed, and the process comes to an end.
