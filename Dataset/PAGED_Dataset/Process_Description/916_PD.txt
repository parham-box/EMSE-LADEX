To begin the process, start with Orders Required and then place a Bulk order. If the condition is "Order with prior internal credit allowance", proceed with processing the order for delivery. However, if the order exceeds the purchaser's credit allowance, there will be an Outstanding Balance. In the case of an Outstanding Balance, a new order is placed and the process ends at the Warehouse. If a new order is placed, it will be recorded in the Accounts Receivable. If Payments are Received, the process continues. However, if no payments are received, the order is dropped. Next, identify the order for installation. If the installation needs to be scheduled, an Installer will be assigned. On the other hand, if the order does not require installation, it will be packed for delivery.
