To begin the process, start with Food Preparation. At the same time, complete the following steps: Employee Checks Food for Any Problems and Employee Readies Ovens/Stoves. If the "Food is OK for Trays", then the Employee Places Food Into Appropriate Trays. However, if the "Food Has Some Type of Problem", then the Contaminated/Out of Date Food is Composted and the process ends. After that, the Employee Places Food Into Appropriate Trays and the Service Processing, and the process ends.
