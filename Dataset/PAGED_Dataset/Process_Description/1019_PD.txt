For TS recruitment, the first step is to advise unsuccessful candidates. If there are "no more candidates", then the position should be re-advertised. However, if the terms and conditions of the offer for a candidate need to be sorted out, it is necessary to check if the candidate has accepted a voluntary redundancy. If the candidate has not accepted, the process continues. On the other hand, if the candidate has accepted, further investigation is required. The recruitment manager sends an Appointment Approval form, which is then received by the next level manager. If the manager is an external resource, they may not authorize the form. However, if the approver is an existing employee of the client, the process continues. If the form is approved, the recruitment manager sends the form and other documentation, which is received by the client HR. The HR department scans the completed form and records the position against the stored position in GovSource. If there are any variations, a complete business case is required. Otherwise, the process continues. The Appointment Approval is carried forward. If the position requires a medical assessment, it is applicable for a 12% rate. Otherwise, a medical assessment is not necessary. For the step of the Preferred Candidate's medical assessments, it is important to note that it can take up to 21 days to arrange and complete. The TS HR coordinator informs the recruitment manager, who then liaises with the HR representative to confirm the offer to the candidate. If the assessment is not satisfactory, the next candidate on the shortlist should be contacted. However, if the assessment is fine, the process continues. The recruitment manager makes a formal verbal offer of employment to the candidate. If the candidate accepts, the recruitment manager creates a formal written offer. If the candidate declines, the process continues. Simultaneously, the commencement pack and letter of appointment are sent to the candidate. Once the candidate receives these documents, if there is a "40%" rate, renegotiation is required. Otherwise, if the candidate accepts, the process continues. If the renegotiation is successful, the process continues. However, if the renegotiation is unsuccessful, the next candidate on the shortlist should be identified. Finally, the process ends.
