To begin the process at ACME Inc., start with the Purchase Order-to-Delivery phase. After that, formally review the purchase invoice and ensure its accuracy. If the invoice amount is greater than $5000, approve the purchase invoice. Otherwise, continue with the process. Once the payment is triggered, the process comes to an end.
