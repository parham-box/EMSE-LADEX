To start the process, we first prioritize orders based on when they were received. Then, we proceed to check the customer's information. If the customer exists, we move on to checking their payment history. On the other hand, if the customer does not exist, we need to verify their customer status. If the payment history is good, we can continue with the process. However, if the customer is a private customer, we send them a declining message. In the case of a wholesaler, we create a new customer and check for product availability. If the products are not available, we produce the missing goods and send a decline message, thus ending the process. If the products are available, we continue with the process and send an order confirmation. Simultaneously, we inform the stock and accounting departments. After packing the goods and writing the invoice, the goods are ready for delivery and the invoice is sent. Once the order is closed, we deliver the goods and invoice to the customer. If payment has been received, we close the order. However, if there is an outstanding payment, we check the quantity of reminders. If there are less than three reminders, we continue with the process. On the other hand, if there are more than three reminders, we activate the donning process, thus ending the process.
