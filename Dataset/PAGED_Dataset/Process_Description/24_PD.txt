The Parts Provision Team starts by requesting authorisation for extra Part(s). If the authorisation is given, the requested Part(s) are obtained from stock and the process ends. If the authorisation is not given, work is stopped until the parts arrive. Once the parts arrive, work resumes and the process ends.
