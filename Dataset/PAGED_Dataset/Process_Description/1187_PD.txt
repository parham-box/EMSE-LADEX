To begin the process, the customer makes an enquiry. After that, we check if the article is in stock. If the article is available, we continue with the process. However, if the article is not available, we abort the enquiry and end the process. At the same time, we complete the following steps simultaneously: reserving the article and calculating the price. First, we reserve the article, and once it is reserved, we calculate the price. After that, we send the offer, and once the offer is sent, we wait for the customer to accept it. Once the customer accepts the offer, we dispatch the article. Finally, once the article is dispatched, the process comes to an end.
