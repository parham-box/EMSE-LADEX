For MyCorp, the process begins by entering expenses. After entering expenses, the next step is to generate a spreadsheet. Once the spreadsheet is generated, the request can be approved or disapproved. If the request is not approved, the process goes back to entering expenses. However, if the request is approved, the expenses can be paid out. The process then checks again if the request is approved or not. If it is not approved, the process goes back to entering expenses. But if it is approved, the expenses can be paid out. Finally, after the expenses are paid out, the process comes to an end.
