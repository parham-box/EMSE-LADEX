For the Part Provision Team, the first step is to identify the parts. If the team needs to elicit information from the customer, they should then check the availability of the parts. On the other hand, if they already have the availability information, they can proceed with the process. If the parts are supplied to the customer, the team can also continue with the process. However, if they need to record the customer's details, they should order and receive the part from Disuki. Once the part is received, the team can then contract the customer. After all the necessary parts are collected, the team can proceed with the payment. Once the payment is made, the process comes to an end.
