To start the process at the Italian restaurant, first enter and ask for the menu. After checking the offers, simultaneously take the following steps: order a glass of red wine and a salad. Once the order is placed, wait for it to arrive and then enjoy the salad and wine. After finishing, you will be asked if you would like a dessert. If you answer "yes" to tiramisu, then go ahead and order it. If you answer "no" to tiramisu, then simply decline any dessert. If you did order tiramisu, wait for it to be served, then enjoy it. Once you are ready, ask for the bill and proceed to pay it. After settling the bill, you can leave the restaurant and the process will be complete.
