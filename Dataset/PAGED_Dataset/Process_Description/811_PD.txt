To initiate the process, begin by processing incoming orders. Once the order is received, proceed to send the collected order list. After collecting the order list, implement it in the database. Once the data is implemented, gather all the information in one excel-file. Subsequently, check the order and customer details. If the "permit data" option is selected, proceed with permitting the data. However, if the "not permit data" option is chosen, the data will not be permitted. After implementing the data in the database, release the data if permitted or contact the selling agency if not permitted. Once the agency is contacted, check the worth of the orders. If the orders are to be released, continue with the process. However, if the order is to be canceled, the process will end. After checking the worth of the orders, if the value is less than 5000, continue with the process. However, if the value is greater than or equal to 5000, the order will need to be signed off by the board of directors. Once the order is signed off, collect the order and start production. Send the memorandum and invoice, followed by the quality report. Check the quality of the production and send the quality report. Once production has started, send the memorandum and collect the goods. Sign off on the memo and pick the goods. After the goods are picked, send them to complete the process.
