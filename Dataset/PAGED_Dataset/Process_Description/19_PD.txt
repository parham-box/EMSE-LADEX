For SSP: The first step is to receive and categorize the invoice. If the instruction is to "Forward Invoice to Admin Officer", then the next step is to sort the invoice. However, if the instruction is to "Reject invoice", then the process ends there. On the other hand, if the instruction is to "Return invoice to client for completion", then the invoice is received and categorized again. Alternatively, if the instruction is to "Process Invoice for SAP Entry", then the invoice is forwarded for validation. Once the invoice is forwarded for validation, it is then validated, and the process ends.
