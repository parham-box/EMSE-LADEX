To start the process, begin by receiving the claim. Then, create the claim and record it. After that, make a decision on the claim. If the claim is to be rejected, then reject it. However, if the claim is to be accepted, offer the benefit. If the claim is rejected, review the claim rejection. On the other hand, if the claim is accepted, prepare the claim discharge. Once the claim discharge is prepared, record the benefit payment. If the claim rejection is accepted, continue the process. But if the claim rejection is not accepted, also continue the process. Finally, the process ends. At the same time, complete the following steps: operate outgoing payment and close the claim.
