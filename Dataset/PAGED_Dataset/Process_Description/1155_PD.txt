To start the process, begin by checking if the order has been received. If the sum of the order is less than 500, then continue with the process. However, if the sum of the order is greater than 2000, compute a discount of 4%. If the sum of the order falls between 1000 and 1500, compute a discount of 3%. Similarly, if the sum of the order falls between 500 and 999, compute a discount of 2%. After checking the sum of the order, if it is still less than 500, continue with the process. If the sum of the order is greater than 2000, compute a discount of 4%. Once again, check the sum of the order. If it is less than 500, continue with the process. If the sum of the order falls between 1000 and 1500, compute a discount of 3%. Likewise, if the sum of the order falls between 500 and 999, compute a discount of 2%. Finally, create the bill and the process will come to an end.
