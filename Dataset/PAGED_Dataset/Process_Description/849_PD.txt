The loan application process starts with receiving the loan application. Simultaneously, the following steps should be completed: assessing the loan risk and checking the credit history. After that, the eligibility of the applicant is assessed. If the applicant is eligible, the acceptance pack is prepared. If the applicant is not eligible, the application is rejected. If the application is rejected, the loan application process ends. On the other hand, if the applicant is eligible, the acceptance pack is prepared. The prepared acceptance pack is then sent. Once the acceptance pack is sent, the process ends.
