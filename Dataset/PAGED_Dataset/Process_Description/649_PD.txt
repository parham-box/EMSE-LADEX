The process begins with periodic planning needs and events that impact demand. Next, we move on to the sales and operation plan, followed by the operations plan. After that, we proceed to the disaggregation stage, which is then followed by planned independent requirements (PIR). Following PIR, we address any changes to MRP elements before moving on to material requirements planning (MRP). Finally, the process concludes with purchase requisitions, planned orders, and dependent requirements.
