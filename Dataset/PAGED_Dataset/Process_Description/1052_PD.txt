For SSP, the process begins by receiving the invoice. After receiving the invoice, it is sorted per client. Once sorted per client, it is then sorted per vendor. The next step is to attach the invoice entry form to the invoice. After attaching the form, the required information is entered onto the form. Following that, the completeness of the invoice is checked. If the invoice is not complete, the process ends. If it is complete, the information for the SLA is entered. The date for completion is also entered and the priority is checked. If the priority is high, a red stamp is placed on the entry invoice. If it is low, the process continues. The invoice compliance is then checked. If it is not complete, the check continues. If it is complete, the process continues. If the invoice needs to be sent to experienced staff, the non-compliance invoice is processed. If it is a normal case, the client is called. If none of these conditions apply, a postal mail is sent requesting complete information and the process ends. Finally, the client is called and information is requested. The invoice is then batched and allocated to DEO, and the process ends.
