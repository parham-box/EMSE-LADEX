To start the process, Course Packet Information Received should be sent, followed by sending the Design to Faculty. After sending the Design to Faculty, the Faculty will choose the design. Next, identify the content that requires copyright clearance and contact the publisher to obtain clearance. If there is a need to "Contact Faculty to inform of denial and ask if new content should be added", then the process should be continued. However, if the "Entire Course Packet Copyright Cleared", then the MPC should Calculate the Course Packet Cost. After calculating the Course Packet Cost, the MPC should add the Bookstore margin to determine the retail price. If the Faculty needs to reconsider the course packet content to decrease the price, then the process should be continued. Alternatively, if the Price of the Course Packet is finalized, then the MPC should notify the Bookstore of the Course packet, Course number, Faculty name, and sections. Once the MPC notifies the Bookstore, the Packet information should be notified to the Bookstore, and the process will end.
