For Practice - Travel Authorization: Initially, a request is made for travel approval. Following that, a travel offer is received from the agency. Once the travel offer is received, the proposal is assessed. If there is a request for changes, another travel offer is obtained. If there are no changes requested, the process continues. The approval is checked, and if it is granted, the check is carried out. Otherwise, a request for travel approval is made. If there is a document finance rejection, the process comes to an end. However, if there is finance approval, a purchase request is created. In the case of director approval, if it is rejected, the process ends. However, if it is approved, the process continues. The purchase request is sent to the travel agency, and then the travel documents are sent to the traveler. Once the travel documents are received, the receipt is confirmed, and then the process comes to an end.
