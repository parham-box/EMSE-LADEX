For the TS recruitment manager, the process begins by receiving applications. After receiving the applications, the next step is to distribute them. Once the applications have been distributed, the manager should provide an evaluation sheet. After providing the evaluation sheet, the manager should then receive the filled evaluation sheets from the applicants. Once all the evaluation sheets have been received, the manager should consolidate the ranking sheet. After consolidating the ranking sheet, the next step is to distribute the consolidated ranking sheet. Following the distribution of the consolidated ranking sheet, the manager should schedule a panel meeting session to select the top 20 candidates. Finally, once the panel meeting session has been conducted and the top 20 candidates have been selected, the process comes to an end.
