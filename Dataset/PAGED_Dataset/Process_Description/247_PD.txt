The process starts with an informational meeting that lasts half a day, involving the customer and the web design team. If the meeting is successful, the next step is to work on the storyboard, which takes a full day and involves the customer and the web design team. However, if the meeting is not successful, the process ends. If the storyboard is successful, the next steps are site design, which takes 10 days and is done by the web design team, and preparing the content. After that, the site development takes 2 days and is also done by the web design team. Once the site is built, it goes through a review process that lasts 1 day. If the review is successful, it moves on to the approval stage, which takes half a day. If the approval is complete, the process ends. However, if the approval is rejected, the site needs to be rebuilt, which takes 3 days. If the rebuild is complete, the process ends. If the rebuild is rejected again, the site needs to be rebuilt again, which also takes 3 days.
