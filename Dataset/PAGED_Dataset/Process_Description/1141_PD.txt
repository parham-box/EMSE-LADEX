Passengers should start the process by undergoing immigration checks, and then they should select the method for exit control checks. If the passenger chooses to use biometrics, they should undergo a check using biometrics. However, if the passenger prefers to use ID documents, they should undergo checks using identity documents. After the exit control checks, if the passenger is denied permission, they should leave the area. On the other hand, if the passenger is allowed to continue, they should proceed to the next step. If the exit control check outcome is unsuccessful, the passenger should leave the area and the process ends. Conversely, if the outcome is successful, the passenger should continue to the next step and the process ends.
