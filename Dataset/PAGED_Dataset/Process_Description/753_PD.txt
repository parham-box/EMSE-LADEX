For buyers, the process begins by choosing a book. After selecting a book, they can either view the book details or see a list of new copies. Alternatively, they can also view a list of used copies. If they choose to view the book details, they have the option to then view a list of new copies or proceed to select a copy and end the process. On the other hand, if they choose to view a list of used copies, they can evaluate the list and then select their preferred copy to complete the process.
