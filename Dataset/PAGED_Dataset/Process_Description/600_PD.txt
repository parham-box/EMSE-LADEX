To initiate the process for the election of a rector, it is necessary to begin with the rector's final year in their current position. Following this, the acceptance of proposals for candidates for the rector position should be launched. Once this is done, the rector can nominate themselves as a candidate for the position. After the nominations have been made, the acceptance of proposals should be stopped. If a candidate meets the required criteria, they should be included in the list of candidates. However, if a candidate does not meet the criteria, they should be informed of the refusal and the process will come to an end. Once the list of candidates has been formed, it should be made public. Simultaneously, the candidates should promote their ideas to the public and organize a public meeting of the Academic Senate. The public meeting should then commence, ensuring that all members are able to vote for a new rector. Following the meeting, an election should be conducted and the votes should be counted. If the voting fails, another election should be conducted. On the other hand, if the voting is successful, the result of the election should be announced. After announcing the result, the public meeting should be concluded and the candidate should be informed of the election results, marking the end of the process.
