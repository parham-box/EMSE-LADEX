To check the account, we start by verifying the amount. If the amount is less than 200 €, we proceed to approve the expense report. However, if the amount is 200 € or more, we evaluate the expense report. If the expense report is deemed acceptable, it is approved and the process comes to an end. On the other hand, if the expense report is not satisfactory, the process also ends.
