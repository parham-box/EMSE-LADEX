To start the process, begin by supplying the requirement and then documenting it. If the order is received via fax, input the order into an Excel file. If the order is received via mail or phone, also input the order into an Excel file. Once the Excel list is complete after a week, send it to the student. Upon receiving the Excel list, type the orders into the MS-Access database. After typing the orders into the database, ensure that it is completed. Once the database is completed, control the incoming order. At the same time, continue to do the check. If the order is correct, release it. Send the Excel list to the student and upon receiving it, continue with the process. However, if the order is incorrect, contact the selling agency. If the order is worth less than 5.000 €, release it. If the order is worth more than 5.000 €, send it for sign off and continue with the check. Contact the selling agency and upon receiving the actual issue, send the order for sign off. Once the order is signed off, contact the client and release the order. Once the order is received by PPC, they will initiate production. If the issue cannot be solved, cancel the order. If the issue can be solved, release the order. After PPC initiates production, the goods will be produced. If the order needs to be cancelled, the process ends. If not, check the quality of the goods. Once the quality is checked, create and send a quality report to the finance department. Release the order via memo and ensure that the memo is achieved in the warehouse. Send the invoice and once it is sent, report the achievement to the finance department. At the same time, commission the goods and sign and send the memo. Also, send the goods and ensure that the signed memo is achieved in the logistic department. Finally, archive the memo and close the order. This marks the end of the process.
