To begin the process, start by entering Mango and then check the clothes. If you decide to pick a skirt, try it on. However, if you choose a dress, try that on instead. After trying on the chosen item, check if it fits. If it doesn't fit, select another skirt. Repeat the process of checking if it fits and selecting another skirt until you find one that fits. Once you find a skirt that fits, continue with the process. Check if it fits again, and if it doesn't, select another item. If it fits, continue with the process. Check if it fits once more, and if it doesn't, select another item. If it fits, continue with the process. If you decide to pick another skirt, try it on. If it fits, continue with the process. Check if you have enough money. If you do, take the dress. If not, take the skirt. Finally, pay for the item and leave Mango, thus ending the process.
