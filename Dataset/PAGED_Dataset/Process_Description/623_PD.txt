To begin the process, start with the Resupply Cycle Triggered step, followed by checking the Inventory Level. If the "Inventory level is at or below the minimum", then proceed to Create Purchase Order. However, if the "Inventory Level is above the minimum", then the process ends. After creating the Purchase Order, move on to Reviewing the Purchase Order. If the Purchase Order is approved, then reserve the funds for the purchase. On the other hand, if the Purchase Order is rejected, then rework the order. Once the funds are reserved, send the Order to Suppliers. In case the order needs to be reworked, review the Purchase Order again. Simultaneously, complete the following steps: the Supplier sends a packing slip and an invoice. Once the packing slip is received, record it. Similarly, when the invoice is received, record it as well. After recording the packing slip and invoice, release the reserved funds and issue the payment to the supplier. Finally, the process ends after the payment is issued to the supplier.
