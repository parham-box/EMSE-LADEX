To initiate the computer repair process, begin by examining the hardware. Once the hardware has been checked, proceed with repairing any issues that were identified. After the necessary repairs have been made, conclude the hardware inspection. Following the completion of the repair process, it is important to test the functionality of the system. If the test results indicate that everything is functioning properly, then the hardware inspection process can be concluded. However, if the test results indicate that there are still issues, then further hardware repairs are required. Once these additional repairs have been made, the hardware inspection process can be concluded.
