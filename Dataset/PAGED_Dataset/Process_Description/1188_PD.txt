To begin the process, the customer needs to make a purchase and then connect to the website. After that, they should search for an item. If they choose to "Add item to cart", they can proceed to checkout. However, if they select "Continue Shopping", they should continue with the process. Once they proceed to checkout, they need to enter their address, shipping method, and payment information. At the same time, they should also authorize the credit card and check the inventory levels. If the credit card is approved and there is inventory in stock, they can continue with the process. However, if the credit card is denied or there is no inventory in stock, the transaction will end. In either case, the order confirmation number should be displayed, followed by the final order being shown to the customer. Additionally, the order should be confirmed and a confirmation notice should be emailed to the customer. Once the order entry is complete, the process will end.
