For the Buyer, the process begins by proceeding to checkout and then verifying the login details. After verifying the login details, the next step is to select the shipping option. Once the shipping option has been selected, the buyer should choose the payment method option. If the buyer selects the credit card payment method, they should continue with the process. However, if they choose the Amazon gift card option, they should also continue with the process. After selecting the payment method, the buyer needs to enter the details for the chosen method and then click "Confirm". Once the confirmation button is clicked, the buyer should review the order. After reviewing the order, the next step is to confirm the order. Once the order is confirmed, the buyer will receive a confirmation email. Upon receiving the confirmation email, the buyer should send the results to Amazon, and the process will then come to an end.
