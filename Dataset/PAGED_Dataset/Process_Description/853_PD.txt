To initiate the Drop-off tech process, the customer is first informed about canceling the order. Then, the question arises: has the order already been fulfilled? If the answer is "Yes," the bag is marked as returned in IS. However, if the answer is "No," the script(s) are marked as declined by the customer in IS. If the bag is indeed returned, it is marked as such in IS. On the other hand, if the bag is not returned, the script(s) are marked as declined by the customer in IS. Once the bag is marked as returned in IS, the script bag is returned as well. Similarly, when the script(s) are marked as declined by the customer in IS, the script order is declined. Finally, the customer notification is processed, and the entire process comes to an end.
