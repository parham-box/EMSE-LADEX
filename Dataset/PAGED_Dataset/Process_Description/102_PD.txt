For Site Support: Initially, an email should be sent to SA's requesting upp info. After that, a message should be received to collect upp info. Once the message is received, the upp info should be collected. Subsequently, the collected upp info should be sent back to Point Sec Admin. After sending back the upp info to Point Sec Admin, the upp info should be consolidated from SA Managers. Following the consolidation of upp info from SA Managers, the info should be entered into Point Sec share point. Once the info is entered into Point Sec share point, it should be exported into an excel spreadsheet. Finally, a Market Place request (11545) should be created, marking the end of the process.
