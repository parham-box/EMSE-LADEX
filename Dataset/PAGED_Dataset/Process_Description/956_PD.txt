To start the process for ACME, begin with the New Resupply Cycle and then Check Levels of Inventory. If the inventory is below or equal to the minimum, generate an Equal to or below minimum Report. If the inventory is greater than the minimum, generate an Above Minimum Report. If the inventory is below or equal to the minimum, generate an Equal to or below minimum Report. If the inventory is greater than the minimum, generate an Above Minimum Report. If the report indicates that the inventory is equal to or below the minimum, create Purchase Orders (POs). If the report indicates that the inventory is above the minimum, the process ends. If the PO is rejected, it needs to be reworked. If the PO is approved, it is printed and released in the system. If the PO is rejected, it needs to be reworked. If the PO is approved, it is printed and released in the system. If the PO is created, it needs to be reviewed. If the PO needs to be reworked, it needs to be created again. Simultaneously, reserve funds for the released POs and mail the POs to the supplier. If funds are reserved for the released POs, receive the Packing Slip. If the POs are mailed to the supplier, receive the inventory. If the Packing Slip is received, proceed to receive the Invoice. If the inventory is received, proceed to receive the Packing Slip. If the Invoice is received, proceed to the Three-way match. If the Three-way match is successful, release the funds. Once the funds are released, issue the payment. After the payment is issued, the Resupply Cycle is complete and the process ends.
