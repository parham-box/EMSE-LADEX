For the customer, the process begins with a request to purchase a motorcycle. Once the request is received, the next step is to either continue the process if a production order is received or update the sales information and proceed to order dispatch. If there are unavailable materials, they are ordered from the supplier. Alternatively, if there are available goods for production, a manufacturing order is placed. Once the materials are received from the supplier, the goods are issued and the motorcycles are produced. At the same time, the stock is updated and the motorcycles are dispatched. After the goods are issued and the motorcycles are produced, the stock is updated and the process ends. Simultaneously, the stock is updated and the sales information is updated.
