To start, please register your participation for the event. If there is no fee, you should proceed to register a post-seminar request. However, if there is a fee, you need to create a purchase request. Once you have registered a post-seminar request, the process will come to an end. Next, you should check if the purchase request has been approved. If it is approved, you will receive an approved notification. On the other hand, if the purchase request is rejected, you will be notified of the rejection. If you receive an approved notification, you should then register a post-seminar request. If you receive a rejection notification, the process will come to an end.
