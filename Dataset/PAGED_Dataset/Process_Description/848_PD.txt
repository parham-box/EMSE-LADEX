To begin the process, the inventory needs to be checked. After that, Mac compares the inventory levels in the spreadsheet with the sales. If the inventory level is high, Mac doesn't need to manually count the inventory. However, if the inventory level is low, Mac needs to manually count the inventory of items. Once Mac counts each item individually, they make a list of items that have a low stock count. Using this list, Mac selects suppliers for the needed products and places the order(s). After receiving the order, the process comes to an end.
