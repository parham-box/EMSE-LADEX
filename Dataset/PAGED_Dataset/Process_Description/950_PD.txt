For J&J local contacts, the first step is to identify the business need. Once the business need has been identified, the next step is to gather the business requirements. After gathering the business requirements, the next step is to create the RFP. Additionally, the business requirements should also be used to create a scorecard. Once the RFP has been created, it should be submitted to vendors. The proposals received from the vendors should then be scored. After scoring the proposals, a response should be requested from the vendors by a set date. Based on the scored proposals, vendors should be downselected to present their proposals. Once the proposals have been received, they should be scored again. Following this, presentations should be attended and the proposals should be rescored based on the Q&A sessions at the presentations. If necessary, pricing and scope adjustments should be requested. The updated proposals should then be reviewed and rescored based on the final proposals. Once the final proposals have been scored, the vendors should be notified of the selection. A contract should be created based on the winning proposal, and this marks the end of the process.
