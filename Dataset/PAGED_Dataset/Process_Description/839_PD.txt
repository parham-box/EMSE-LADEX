To begin the process for AMAG, start by initiating the Start command. After that, proceed to receive the sealed shipment. Once the sealed shipment has been received, the next step is to register the spare parts. When registering the spare parts, it is important to pay attention to the use of barcode scanners. After the spare parts have been registered, the next task is to clear customs. Once customs clearance has been obtained, enter the information into the IT system. Finally, when the information has been entered into the IT system, the product will be made available in the central warehouse, marking the end of the process.
