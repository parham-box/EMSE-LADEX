To begin the process, the customer should first request information about the organization and then schedule an appointment. If the customer is in the "Intake" stage, they should proceed with "Control and measurement". However, if the customer is a "Potential client", the process will come to an end. After the "Control and measurement" stage, the customer should revisit after two weeks. If the target has been reached, the process will come to an end. However, if the customer is dissatisfied or for any other reason, the process will also come to an end.
