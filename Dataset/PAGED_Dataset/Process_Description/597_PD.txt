To begin the process, start with Insurance "emergency" and then analyze the insurance agreement. If there is coverage, offer immediate help. If there is no coverage, send out an offer for emergency help. If the offer is rejected, ask for a rejection notification. If it is accepted, proceed with internal accounting. Repeat the same steps if necessary. The process concludes once all steps have been completed.
