To find a DS through ONS Bootstrapping, we start by checking if the input is a "URN". If it is, we proceed with the step of "ONS-Resolving URN to a domain-name". If the input is a "URL", we simply continue with the process. After this, we again check if the input is a "URN" or a "URL" and take the corresponding action. Once we have resolved the URN to a domain-name, we send a DNS query. The result of this query is a list of URLs, which we then use to link to a designated DS. Finally, we link to the designated DS and the process comes to an end.
