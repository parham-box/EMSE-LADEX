To begin the Expense Report process, start by receiving the expense report. After that, verify the account and review the report. If the report is accepted, proceed with processing the reimbursement. However, if the report is rejected, send an Expense Rejection Notification and end the process. Once the reimbursement is processed, proceed with the payment and end the process.
