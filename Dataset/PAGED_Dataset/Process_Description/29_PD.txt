For the DMS Parts Provision Team, the first step is to gather information about the part from the customer, including the make, model, and year. Once this information is obtained, the team proceeds to check the availability of the part in the local inventory. If the part is found to be available locally, it is retrieved from the inventory. However, if the part is not available locally, the team records the customer's details. After retrieving the part from the local inventory, the process comes to an end. On the other hand, if the part is not available locally, the team proceeds to record the customer's details and then orders the part from Disuki. Once the part is ordered from Disuki, the process comes to an end.
