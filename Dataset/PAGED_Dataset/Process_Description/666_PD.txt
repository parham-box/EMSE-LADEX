To begin the process, start by claiming what is requested and then check the insured status of the claimant. If the claimant is insured, proceed to evaluate the claim. However, if the claimant is not insured, reject the claim. Once the claim is rejected, notify the claimant and the process comes to an end. If the claim is a simple one or a complex one, send the relevant forms accordingly. Once the forms are returned, check them for completeness. If all the relevant details are provided, proceed to register the claim. However, if not all the relevant details are provided, inform the claimant to complete them. Once the claim is registered, the process comes to an end.
