To begin the validation process, start by checking the received invoice for any errors. If any errors are found, continue with the process. If no errors are found, mark the "invoice entered correctly" box. Simultaneously, highlight any errors on the invoice entry form and keep a record of the DEO's performance. Once the "invoice entered correctly" box is ticked, the invoice is checked and the process ends. If an error exists, the process also ends.
