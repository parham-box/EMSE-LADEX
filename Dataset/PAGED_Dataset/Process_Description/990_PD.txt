In the telecom industry, the process begins with receiving an order request. After that, the order is registered and evaluated. If the evaluation result is "NOK", then the order is considered as "NOK" and the process comes to an end. On the other hand, if the evaluation result is "ok", then the installation process takes place. If the installation is not successful, the order is considered as "NOK" and the process ends. However, if the installation is successful, the next step is to check the installation. Once the installation is verified, the billing is prepared. Finally, if everything is in order, the order is marked as "ok" and the process is completed.
