For testing purposes, the process should be continued from the beginning. If the value of "x" is greater than 2, the process should be continued. However, if the value of "x" is less than 2, the process should still be continued. Similarly, if the value of "x" is greater than 2, the process should be continued. On the other hand, if the value of "x" is less than 2, the process should still be continued.
