To begin the process for a Casual Admin Assistant, start by commencing the reference check and then proceed to check the applicants' referees. If an "Incomplete Referee Report" is received, the process ends due to the report not being finished on time. However, if a "Complete Referee Report" is obtained, send it to archive applications. After sending the applications to the archive, proceed to evaluate and rank the candidates, and then the process concludes.
