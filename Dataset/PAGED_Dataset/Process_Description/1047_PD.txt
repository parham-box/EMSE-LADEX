To begin the process, Rental Items are Returned to the Store. If the "Customer returns the items to the store," then we can continue the process. However, if the "Delivery Crew picks-up items at the event site," then we also continue the process. During this step, the items are counted and compared to the original contract. If the "Order is complete and all items were returned," then we proceed with the process. However, if the "Order is incomplete and items are missing," we still continue the process. Similarly, if the "Order is complete but items are damaged," we email the customer to inform them of the damage and additional charges. After this, if the "Items are packed for an existing order," we continue the process. Alternatively, if the "Items are stored for future orders," we also continue the process. In case of missing items and replacement charges, we email the customer to inform them. Additionally, if there are damaged items and additional charges, we temporarily take them out of inventory. If the "Customer returns the missing items," we continue the process. However, if the "Customer does not return the missing items," we still continue the process. Finally, when the process is complete, it ends. If the "Items are repaired and added into inventory," we continue the process. On the other hand, if the "Items can't be repaired and are discarded," we email the customer with replacement charges. Lastly, the items are packed for an existing order. If the "Items are packed for an existing order," we continue the process. If the "Items are stored for future orders," we also continue the process. Once again, when the process is complete, it ends. The customer is then emailed with replacement charges, and the process is complete.
