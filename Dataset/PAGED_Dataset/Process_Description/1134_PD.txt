For ICT Logistics: Initially, we start by receiving the shipment documents. Once we have received the documents, we proceed with the verification process. If the verification is successful, we continue with the next steps. However, if the verification fails, we send a request for the missing documents. Once we have received all the required documents, we move on to the next tasks. These tasks include preparing the invoice, sending the shipment documents to the client, and accounting for the invoice. After verifying and accounting for the invoice, if everything is correct, we proceed to the next steps. However, if there are any errors, we send a request for correction. If the correction is needed, we continue with the process. Simultaneously, we also send the electronic version of the invoice and the payment order. Once the electronic invoice is sent, we wait for the payment to be received and then proceed with the payment booking.
