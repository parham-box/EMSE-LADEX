To start the SSP process, first ensure that the Invoice is ready for verification. After that, check for invoice completeness. Once the invoice completeness is confirmed, proceed to check for SLA. Once the SLA is checked, move on to checking for invoice compliance. Once these checks are completed, the batched invoices are allocated to the Data Entry Officer and this is done by 9 am on the next working day. The next step is to process the invoice batch and then take it to the outbox. It is important to note that for the step "Process invoice batch", this should be repeated until all invoices are processed. After taking the batch to the outbox, make sure to clear the outbox of the Data Entry Officer every hour. This process of clearing the outbox is done every hour until the outbox is completely cleared, which marks the end of the process.
