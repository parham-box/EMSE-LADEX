To initiate the PICKUP process, begin by conducting Quality control. Once completed, proceed to seal the script in a bag and store the bags in alphabetical order. Afterward, wait until the customer arrives. At the same time, carry out the following tasks simultaneously: search for the correct bag and verify the customer's identity. If the customer has any complaints, make an effort to resolve them. Otherwise, proceed to collect the required payment from the customer. Once the payment is received, the happy customer can leave, and the process concludes. However, if the customer is not satisfied and refuses to pay, they will sadly leave, and the process will come to an end.
