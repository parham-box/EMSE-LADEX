To begin the process, acquire a new customer and then proceed to take the contract to Ms. Hannover. Once the contract has been transferred, input it into the database. If the contract is deemed okay, organize a suitable team and the process will come to an end. However, if there are any missing details, contact the customer directly and the process will also come to an end.
