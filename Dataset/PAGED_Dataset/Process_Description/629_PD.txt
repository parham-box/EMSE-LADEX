To initiate the process in the Pathology Department, begin with the Gross pathology request that has arrived. After that, proceed with the Registration gross pathology request. Once the registration is complete, assign a container to the gross pathology request. 

During the "Registration gross pathology request" step, make sure to create a barcode scan at the start. 

After assigning a container, move on to the Specimen description. 

For the "Specimen description" step, pay attention to the scan start. Then, pay attention to the scan end. Finally, pay attention to the scan start again for the Registration gross pathology request (cont.) step. 

Following that, proceed with Macroscopic description writing. Simultaneously, complete the following steps: Tissue processing, check if "Digitalization?" is required. If the answer is "no," continue the process. If the answer is "yes," proceed with Digitalization. 

Next, check if "Digitalization?" is required again. If the answer is "no," continue the process. If the answer is "yes," proceed with Digitalization. 

After that, assign cases to the pathologist and then move on to Microscopic examination and diagnosis. 

Once the microscopic examination and diagnosis are complete, write the pathology report. After writing the report, confirm it. 

Once the pathology report is confirmed, deliver it. Then, proceed with the post-report processing. 

To conclude the pathology procedure, close it. Finally, deliver the pathology report and complete the post-report processing.
