To begin the process, start by identifying the vacancy. If there is no suitable candidate available, then advertise the vacancy. However, if there is a suitable candidate available, then continue with the process. If there is still no suitable candidate available, then advertise the vacancy again. On the other hand, if there is a suitable candidate available, then proceed with selecting the appropriate applicant. Once the candidate is appointed, the process comes to an end.
