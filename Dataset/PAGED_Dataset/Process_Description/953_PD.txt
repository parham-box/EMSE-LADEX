To begin with, for CAB, the first step is to assess the change request. After assessing the change request, the next step is to check the affected systems for any impacts on the business unit. Once the systems have been checked, the next task is to determine whether the change request should be approved or not. If the change request should be approved in its current state, then it is approved. However, if the change request should not be approved in its current state, further evaluation is needed to determine if the change will be acceptable with more information provided. If the change request is ultimately approved, the change is implemented. On the other hand, if the change is deemed unacceptable, it is rejected. In this case, a request for more information is made to the Change Coordinator. The request is then followed by an email enquiry to the Change Coordinator. After that, the approval register is updated within a timeframe of 3 business days. The email enquiry is also forwarded to the Change Requester. If there are no further inquiries or issues, the process concludes after 3 business days. However, if there are inquiries from the CAB, a response is expected within 1-3 business days. Once the response is received from the requester, it is forwarded to the CAB for further evaluation. Based on the response, a final determination is made regarding the approval of the change request.
