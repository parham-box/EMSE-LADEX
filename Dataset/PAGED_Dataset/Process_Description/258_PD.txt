For developers practicing BPMN execution TDD, the first step is to understand the BPMN Model. After that, they should write a failing test. To make the test pass, they need to extend BPMN/mocks. Once the test is green, they should check if the level satisfies the project requirements. If it does, the process ends. If not, they should continue the process. If the test is not green, they should upgrade the test level. After that, they need to check if the level satisfies the project requirements again. If it does, the process ends. If not, they should upgrade the test level once more.
