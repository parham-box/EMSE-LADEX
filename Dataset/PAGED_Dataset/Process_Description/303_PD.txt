To begin the process in the Admin Office, first check if it has started. After that, verify the completeness of the invoices. If they are marked as "Uncompleted", they should be returned to the client through postal mail. However, if they are marked as "Completed", the process should be continued. If the invoices are still marked as "Uncompleted", they should be returned to the client via postal mail. On the other hand, if they are marked as "Completed", the process should be continued. Once the invoices are returned to the client, receive the completed ones. Then, mark the relevant box on the invoice entry form and proceed with checking if the process has been completed. Finally, the process ends.
