For the company, the first step is to look at the order. If the order is to be rejected, the process should continue. If the order is to be accepted, the process should also continue. At the same time, two steps need to be completed: preparing the assembling order and checking availability. If there is a backorder, availability needs to be checked again and the process ends. If the item can be reserved, the process should continue. The next steps are to assemble the bike and then ship the product.
