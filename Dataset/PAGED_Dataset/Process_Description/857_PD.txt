To begin the process for the Ground Floor, we start when the invoice arrives. The client is then asked to confirm if payment is possible. If the answer is "yes", we add the relevant costs center to the invoice and the process is complete. However, if the answer is "no", we reject the invoice. If the invoice is rejected, we return it to the client and the process ends.
