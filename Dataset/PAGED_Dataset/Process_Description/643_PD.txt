To begin with, you should choose your destination and calculate the distance. While doing so, continue to check if you need to book a train or a flight. If the answer is "no", then proceed to book a train. However, if the answer is "yes", then book a flight. If a code is available within 24 hours, the process will end. Otherwise, if 24 hours have passed, you should call a travel agency. If a code is available, the process will end along with the hotel reservation. On the other hand, if a code is not available, you should cancel your journey. In that case, the process will end as well.
