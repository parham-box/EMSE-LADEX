To start the ExpenseReport process, begin by clicking on "Start" and then selecting "Edit Report". If the expense is greater than 1000, the report should be reviewed. However, if the expense is less than or equal to 1000, you should proceed to check if there is a need for translation. If translation is required, proceed to translate the receipts. If not, confirm the receipts. After this, evaluate the review decision. If the report is rejected, edit the report. If it is approved, continue to check if there is a need for translation. Once again, evaluate the review decision. If the report is rejected, edit the report. If it is approved, translate the receipts and then confirm them. Finally, evaluate the receipts decision. If the receipts are accepted, proceed to process the expense. If they are rejected, edit the report. The process ends by processing the expense and then ending it.
