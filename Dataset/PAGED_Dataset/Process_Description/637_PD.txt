To start the process, begin with an informal meeting. After the meeting, check if it has been successful. If it is, then schedule another meeting. However, if the meeting is not successful, the process is done and it ends. If the meeting is successful, proceed with web site design and the preparation of contents and completion of the initial draft. After the web site design, move on to web site development. For the preparation of contents and completion of the initial draft, conduct a marketing review and then proceed with the preparation of the final version. Once the web site development is complete, move on to the building phase. After the marketing review, also proceed with the preparation of the final version. If any of these steps are not successful, the process is done and it ends. Finally, after the preparation of the final version, move on to the building phase. Once the building phase is complete, conduct a review activity. After the review activity, the final activity is the approval. Check if the site has been approved. If it has, then the process is done and it ends. However, if it has not been approved, proceed with the building phase. If the site is approved, the process is done and it ends. If it is not approved, continue with the building phase.
