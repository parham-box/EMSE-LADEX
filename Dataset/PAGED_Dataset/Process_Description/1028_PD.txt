At the start, we receive a form. After receiving the form, we check if it is complete. If it needs to be sent back, the process ends. However, if we need to check the income, we continue with the process. At the same time, we complete the following steps: checking deductibles and checking the house. Then, we make a decision. If we need to check the declaration, the process ends. Otherwise, if we need to invite the declarant, the process also ends.
