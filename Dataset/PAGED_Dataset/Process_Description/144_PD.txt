To create promotional YouTube videos, start by defining the audience. Once the audience is defined, develop a concept. After the concept is developed, determine the form or style. Once the form or style is determined, write the script. After the script is written, create a storyboard. Once the storyboard is created, shoot the video. After shooting the video, record the narration. Once the narration is recorded, create the graphics. After the graphics are created, find or create the music. Once the music is found or created, capture the video to the computer. After capturing the video, import the audio, including the narration, music, and sound effects. Once the audio is imported, import the graphics. After importing the graphics, create titles, subtitles, and credits. Once the titles, subtitles, and credits are created, edit everything together. After editing everything together, upload it to YouTube. Once uploaded to YouTube, the process ends.
