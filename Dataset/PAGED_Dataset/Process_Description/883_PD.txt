To begin the process for the company, start by receiving the invoice. After receiving the invoice, ask the client to confirm it. Once the invoice is confirmed by the client, proceed to confirm the service information with the client. Once the client has confirmed the service information, categorize the invoices. After categorizing the invoices, forward them to the admin officers. Finally, the process ends.
