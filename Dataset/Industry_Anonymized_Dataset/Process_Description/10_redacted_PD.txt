1. Start the procedure.
2. Retrieve all active alarms and alarm details.

How are you performing the procedure? If using Graphical User Interface then go to step 4, if using Command Line Interface then go to step 6

4. Retrieve active alarm data.
5. Refer to [DOCUMENT_A] for retrieving active alarm data.
6. Enter [COMMAND] to show alarm details.
[EXAMPLE]
7. Wear appropriate [SAFETY_DEVICE] to dissipate electrostatic charges.

Is the required [SAFETY_DEVICE] being worn? If yes go to step 51, if no go to step 8

51. Connect the [SAFETY_DEVICE] cord to a [GROUND_POINT].
8. Is this a duplex configuration system?

If this is a  Duplex configuration then go to  step 52, if Simplex then go to step 13

52. Identify which [MODULE] is in an idle state in the duplex configuration.

How are you performing this step?if using Command Line Interface then go to step 10, if using Graphical User Interface then go to step 12

10. Enter [COMMAND] to show idle modules.
[EXAMPLE]
11. Verify the operational-state indicates 'idle' on the screen.
12. From the [MENU_A] menu, select the module to retrieve the inventory for.
13. Change the equipment admin-state of the module to be replaced to 'Disabled'.
14. Refer to [DOCUMENT_B] procedure.
15. Replace the idle [MODULE] first.
16. Ensure the [LED_A] on the module faceplate is off before removing the module.

Are you replacing the [MODULE] in a [SHELF_MODEL_A]? If yes then go to step 18, if not then go to step 22

18. Unfasten the retention screw on the module using a [TOOL].
19. Pull the fan module using the handle until it is fully disengaged.
20. Remove the fan module using the handle and place it in a safe location.
21. Refer to [DATA_SOURCE_A].
22. Open the latches of the module to be replaced.
23. Use the latches to pull and unseat the [MODULE] from the backplane.
24. Change the provisioned [COMPONENT_ID] for the slot.
25. Before changing the [COMPONENT_ID], you must de-provision all channels.
26. To change the [COMPONENT_ID], delete and re-create the slot using [COMMAND].
[EXAMPLE]
27. Position the replacement [MODULE] into the slot tracks and slide it in to partially seat it.
28. Push on both latch handles simultaneously to fully seat the [MODULE].
29. Refer to [DATA_SOURCE_B].
30. Refer to [DATA_SOURCE_C].

Are you working with a [SHELF_MODEL_A]? If yes go to step 53 if not go to step 33

53. Install the fan module in the replacement [MODULE] immediately after insertion.
32. Refer to [DOCUMENT_C] procedure.
33. The module status LEDs indicate initialization progress. Do not remove the module if a status [LED_B] is flashing or [LED_A] is on.

If the '[ALARM_NAME]' alarm is active go to step 54, if not go to step 35

54. Wait until the alarm clears before continuing.
35. Change the equipment admin-state of the module to 'Enabled'.
47. Refer to [DOCUMENT_C] procedure.

Was this procedure for a simplex or duplex configuration? If Simplex configuration go to step 37, if Duplex configuration go to step 48

37. The procedure is now completed.
48. In a duplex configuration, an [ALARM_NAME_B] will be raised.
38. Perform an equipment switch from the currently active module to the newly inserted standby module.
39. Refer to [DOCUMENT_D].
49. After the switch, repeat steps for the other module.
13. Change the equipment admin-state of the module to be replaced to 'Disabled'.
40. After the second module is replaced, the [ALARM_NAME_B] will be cleared. Ensure there are no active alarms against the new modules. You have completed the procedure.
